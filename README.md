# ArtYearPredict
Project 3

For project 3, Luke Pharr, Rupali Mayekar, Andrea Karaffa, David Richter and Jen Vacanti will use convolutional neural networks to create a model capable of predicting the year a painting by a specific artist was executed. Two likely candidates for this research are Mark Rothko (data retrievable here: https://www.wikiart.org/en/mark-rothko/all-works#!#filterName:all-paintings-chronologically,resultType:masonry) or Morris Louis (data retrievable here: http://morrislouis.org/paintings). The project will require downloading images and metadata for a large sample of the artist's work (probably manually), building a convolutional neural network to build a model using that data (possibly uploading those images to a neural network via Flask), and finally testing the model against a reserved subsection of test data. It may also be of interest to test our model for close colleagues of the artist we base our research onâ€”Adolph Gottlieb and Barnett Newman in the case of Rothko, or Kenneth Noland in the case of Morris Louis.
