## Building a Model
This project requires downloading images of Rothko paintings and metadata, computer metrics for those images, building a machine learning model using that data and finally testing the model against a reserved subsection of test data. 
* #### Extract Painting Metrics
Use Ski-Kit Image to gather the following metrics per painting: 
1. Average color
2. Aspect ratio
3. Number of colors
4. Image Entropy

* #### Model Selection
We will start with a linear regression model and cluster model to test results and improve. 

## Project Presentation
The tool and project information will be organized on one website. 

## Additional Considerations
It may be of interest to test the model against Rothko's close colleagues like Adolf Gottlieb and Barnet to determine similarity and influence.
