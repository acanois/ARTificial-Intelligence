Project 3

For project 3, Luke Pharr, Rupali Mayekar, Andrea Karaffa, David Richter and Jen Vacanti will use scikit-image to produce a dataset of Rothko painting metadata and image metrics (such as average color, and entropy). The project will require downloading images and metadata for a large sample of the artist's work (probably manually), computing metrics for those images using scikit-image, building a machine learning model using that data, and finally testing the model against a reserved subsection of test data. It may also be of interest to test our model for close colleagues of the artist we base our research onâ€”Adolph Gottlieb and Barnett for example.
